<H2>Description Summary</H2>

A timed code quiz on the fundementals of JavaScript that allows you to save your scores to local storage.

<H2>Usage</H2>

When you click the "Lets Begin" button the timer will begin and you will be met with your first prompt. Once you click on one of the answers you will be told whether or not it was correct and moved to the next question. A wrong answer will take 5 seconds off of your remaining time while a correct answer will continue the time as normal. Once you are either out of time or you get through all the questions you will be able to log your initials along with your remaining time which will be viewable up in the leaderboard. Also in the leaderboard is the option to reset your top times or to go ahead and restart the quiz.
