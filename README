<H2>Detailed Description</H2>

When you click the "Lets Begin" button the timer will begin and you will be met with your first prompt.

A wrong answer will take 5 seconds off of your remaining time while a correct answer will continue the time as normal. Once you are either out of time or you get through all the questions you will be able to log your initials along with your remaining time which will be viewable up in the leaderboard. Also in the leaderboard is the option to reset your top times or to go ahead and restart the quiz.
